INTRODUCTION

Customer churn is used to describe a situation where customers or subscribers stop doing business with a company or service within a given period of time. A high rate of customer churn impedes business growth. A study has shown that it is 5 to 25 times more expensive to get new customers than to retain existing ones. Therefore companies need to find ways to prevent this or bring it to the barest minimum.

Hence, the objective of this project is to create a model that can identify potential churn candidates beforehand so that the company can take proactive actions to make them stay.
